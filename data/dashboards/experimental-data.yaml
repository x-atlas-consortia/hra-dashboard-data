title: Experimental Data
description: >-
  The HRA is constructed from experimental data with full provenance to original data sources. Highest quality datasets are used to compute HRA Cell Type Populations (HRApop, representing the number of cells per cell type) for anatomical structures. Shown below are basic statistics for the UNIVERSE of all healthy human datasets considered for HRApop as well as statistics for the ATLAS dataset used for HRApop construction. Note that cell type annotations (CTann) are computed for proteomics data and for transcriptomics data; in both cases assigned cell types have Cell ontology IDs. Many datasets have been spatially registered using the Registration User Interface (RUI). 
  Bar graphs that detail how many datasets have been mapped to the HRA by what methods, and a Sankey diagram with nine vertical bars showing from left to right, 
  for all datasets: source/portal, donor sex, donor age, donor race/ethnicity, donor BMI, organ, whether the dataset has a single-cell (sc) transcriptomics cell type population summary or a sc-proteomics summary or no summary, whether the dataset is RUI-registered into a HRA 3D Digital Object (organ), and whether it is part of the atlas.
