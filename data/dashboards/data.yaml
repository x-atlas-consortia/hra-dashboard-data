  The HRA Knowledge Graph interlinks more than a dozen data types in the
  Human Reference Atlas. Key counts are provided plus the number of
  anatomical structure and cell type terms added to existing ontologies
  since 2023. Visualizations show the growth of the HRA since the first 
  release, its 3D spatial coverage, the number of data type instances per
  organ, the number of terms added to existing ontologies, and an exemplary
  visualization of 3D structures within the left female kidney.
