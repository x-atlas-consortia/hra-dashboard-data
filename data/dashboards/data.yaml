  The HRA Knowledge Graph interlinks the 10 different data types in the
  Human Reference Atlas. Key counts are provided plus the number of
  anatomical structure and cell type terms added to existing ontologies.
  Visualizations show the growth of the HRA since the first release, its
  3D spatial coverage, and the number of data type instances per
  anatomical structure.
